# AWS Credential Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Jenkins AWS credentials (ID: `aws-cli`) into the DatabaseDeployJenkinsfile pipeline to secure all Terraform and AWS CLI operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Terraform Init Stage
- **Updated**: Wrapped `terraform init` command with AWS credentials
- **Purpose**: Authenticates Terraform with AWS provider during initialization
- **Credential Type**: Username/Password mapped to AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

### 2. Terraform Validate Stage  
- **Updated**: Wrapped `terraform validate` command with AWS credentials
- **Purpose**: Ensures validation can access AWS provider configuration
- **Security**: Prevents validation failures due to missing credentials

### 3. Terraform Plan Stage
- **Updated**: Wrapped `terraform plan` and `terraform show` commands with AWS credentials
- **Purpose**: Enables plan generation by authenticating AWS API calls
- **Artifacts**: Plan output archiving remains outside credential scope

### 4. Deploy/Destroy Stage
- **Updated**: Wrapped both `terraform apply` and `terraform destroy` commands with AWS credentials
- **Purpose**: Secures actual resource deployment and destruction operations
- **Coverage**: Both deployment and destruction workflows protected

### 5. Scale Operations Stage
- **Updated**: Wrapped scaling Terraform commands for both database types:
  - Cassandra: `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` for ASG scaling
  - DynamoDB: `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` for capacity scaling
- **Purpose**: Enables dynamic scaling operations with proper authentication

### 6. Backup Operations Stage
- **Updated**: Wrapped all backup-related commands with AWS credentials:
  - `terraform state pull` for state backup
  - `terraform output` for resource information retrieval
  - `aws ec2 create-image` for Cassandra AMI backups
  - `aws dynamodb create-backup` for DynamoDB backups
- **Purpose**: Ensures backup operations can access both Terraform state and AWS services

## Credential Configuration

### Jenkins Credential Store
- **Credential ID**: `aws-cli`
- **Type**: Username with password
- **Mapping**:
  - Username → `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - Password → `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### Security Implementation
- All AWS operations now use `withCredentials` blocks
- Credentials are scoped only to the specific commands that need them
- No credential exposure in logs or artifacts
- Temporary credential injection during execution only

## Operations Secured

### Terraform Operations
- ✅ Initialization with AWS provider
- ✅ Configuration validation
- ✅ Resource planning
- ✅ Resource deployment
- ✅ Resource destruction
- ✅ State management
- ✅ Output retrieval
- ✅ Scaling operations

### AWS CLI Operations
- ✅ EC2 AMI creation for Cassandra backups
- ✅ DynamoDB backup creation
- ✅ Resource information queries

### Operations NOT Requiring Credentials
- ✅ Cost estimation calculations (uses local scripts)
- ✅ File archiving and cleanup
- ✅ Log management
- ✅ Local file operations

## Testing Recommendations

### Pre-Deployment Testing
1. **Credential Validation**: Test Jenkins credential store configuration
2. **Permission Testing**: Verify AWS IAM permissions for all operations
3. **Pipeline Testing**: Run pipeline in test environment

### Required AWS Permissions
The AWS credentials must have permissions for:
- EC2: Instance management, AMI creation, describe operations
- DynamoDB: Table management, backup operations
- IAM: Role and policy management (for resource deployment)
- CloudWatch: Monitoring and logging (if enabled)

### Security Validation
- Confirm credentials are not logged in Jenkins console output
- Verify credential scope is limited to required operations only
- Test credential rotation compatibility

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Security**: All AWS operations now properly authenticated
2. **Compliance**: Follows Jenkins security best practices
3. **Reliability**: Eliminates authentication-related pipeline failures
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized credential management
5. **Flexibility**: Easy credential rotation without pipeline changes

## Next Steps

1. **Test Pipeline**: Run complete pipeline test with both database types
2. **Permission Audit**: Verify AWS IAM permissions meet pipeline requirements
3. **Documentation Update**: Update pipeline usage documentation with credential requirements
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for credential-related failures

*Note: This integration ensures secure, reliable AWS operations across all database deployment scenarios while maintaining the pipeline's flexibility for both Cassandra and DynamoDB deployments.*
